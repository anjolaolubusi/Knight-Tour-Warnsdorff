# PyTour
PyTour is an implementation and visualization of the Warnsdorff algorithm of the Knight Tour Problem.

## Implementation
To explain briefly, a knight's tour is a sequences of moves that a knight can make to visit each square once. The Warnsdorff algorithm works by making the knight move to the square with the least onwards moves.

## Building and Running
